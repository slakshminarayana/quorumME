This program exercises a Quorum based mutual exclusion algorithm

Save the project files in 'maekawa' directory

In order to run the program ensure that you are outside the maekawa directory that includes all the java class files.

To compile the program, use the script named "script" located inside the maekawa directory using the command:
chmod +x script && ./script

To run the program, use the command (as package name is maekawa):
java maekawa.Project2 arg1 arg2 arg3 &

where :
	arg1 represents the process index in the configuration file, 
	arg2 represents whether the process executes critical section and 
	arg3 represents whether the process executes verification.

Need to run java maekawa.Project2 arg1 arg2 arg3 & from each dcXX machine.

For "Configuration File":
1. Download the configuration file from Project 2
2. Make changes to it as per your requirement
3. Save it in the 'maekawa' directory, where rest of the project 2 is saved
